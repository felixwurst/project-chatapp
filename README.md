# Project: ChatApp

## Build a Full Stack Application with Node.js

[Live Demo](https://chat.felixwurst.de/)

If you just want to try out the app and don't want to register right away, you can use this login for that. `Username: test / Password: 123`

### Description:

With this app we want to enable users to communicate with each other in real time. Besides sending text messages there are other possibilities like sending pictures and setting emojis. There is also a choice of different chat rooms. Beyond that, further rooms can be created. Our goal is to provide an intuitive user interface to delight the user with an easy to handle and fast communication channel.

### Details:

This chat app is a realtime broadcast with WebSockets. It is a protocol that allows a bilateral synchronous exchange between a client and a server. We are using Node.js for webserver, Express.js for the gateway to one of the single chats. The chat is running with Socket.io. It is a library based on the WebSockets protocol to make the use of it easier. For the connection to a database MySQL was used as the management system and phpMyAdmin as its administration tool. The application was built with Vanilla JS.
