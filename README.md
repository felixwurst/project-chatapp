# Project: Build a Full Stack Application

## Creating a Chat App

### Demo:

[Chat App](https://www.coding-school.org/)

### Description:

With this app we want to enable users to communicate with each other in real time. Besides sending text messages there are other possibilities like sending pictures and setting emojis. There is also a choice of different chat rooms. Beyond that, further rooms can be created. Our goal is to provide an intuitive user interface to delight the user with an easy to handle and fast communication channel.

### Details:

This chat app is a realtime broadcast with _WebSockets_. It is a protocol that allows a bilateral synchronous exchange between a client and a server. We are using _Node.js_ for webserver, _Express.js_ for the gateway to one of the single chats. The chat is running with _Socket.io_. It is a library based on the _WebSockets_ protocol to make the use of it easier. For the connection to a database _MySQL_ was used as the management system and _phpMyAdmin_ as its administration tool. The application was built with _Vanilla JS_.

### Tools:

-   Vanilla JS
-   Node.js
